### Repository Structure

| Directory             | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./.github/workflows` | GitHub Actions workflow definitions.                                                                                    |
| `./cmd/accretion`     | The CLI is used for both running the server core and for interacting with the server core over GraphQL.                 |
| `./cypress`           |                                                                                                                         |
| `./graphql`           | The channel of communication with the server core used by all other interaction methods, along with 3rd party services. |
| `./internal/domain`   | Code that defines the core application logic.                                                                           |
| `./internal/gateway`  | Defines how the `domain` interfaces with external systems.                                                              |
| `./spa`               | A Vue client application that interacts with the server core via GraphQL.                                               |

### Server Core

> 🚧 Placeholder

### Persistence

The source of truth is a series of `HistoricalFact` events that are processed to form multiple projections including
a `SearchProjection` and `GraphProjection`. Each projection is specifically designed to support different use cases.
